The "latex-packages" subdirectory contains the necessary LaTeX macro files
to compile any .tex files in the "doc" subdirectory of this project.  To
do so, copy these files to an appropriate location in your TeX installation
tree, or into the same directory as the source .tex file you're 
compiling.  

This will only be a concern to those who are editing and recompiling the 
original .tex file.  This distribution includes an output PDF of any documentation
files written in .tex for convenience.  

If you do want to work on the original .tex files, I strongly recommend doing so
within Eclipse, using the TeXclipse plug-in, which is what I did.  The downside of this plugin 
is that the current version is clumsy to configure, but once configured it works well.  This allows you 
to have the simulation code open in the same IDE as the .tex file, and the eclipse 
environment provides a fairly decent LaTeX editor.  In OS X other great choices are TeXShop
(probably my favorite LaTeX GUI for Mac), although the programming editor TextMate is 
also excellent.  I'm less impressed with iTeXMac, although that's a pretty common 
choice it seems.
